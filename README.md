# Mini Redis
Mini Redis is a lightweight, educational project designed to understand the inner workings of distributed systems by building a miniature version of Redis. This project focuses on core principles such as consensus algorithms, replication, sharding, and consistent hashing, while also implementing key Redis features like backup, restore, and configuration management.

# Project Goals

## The primary objectives of this project are:

- [ ] Learn Raft Consensus Algorithm: Implement Raft to handle leader election and ensure consistent state across multiple nodes.
Replication: Understand and implement replication techniques, ensuring data durability and fault tolerance across distributed nodes.
- [ ] Sharding and Consistent Hashing: Explore horizontal scalability through sharding, using consistent hashing to evenly distribute data across nodes.
- [ ] Redis-like Features: Aim to mimic 80% of Redis's features
- [ ] Master-Replica Setup: Build a master-replica architecture to handle read/write separation and improve availability.
- [ ] Sharding with Replication: Combine sharding and replication for both horizontal scaling and high availability.


## Learning Objectives
Distributed Consensus: Hands-on experience with the Raft consensus algorithm.
- [ ] Replication: Understand how to achieve high availability and fault tolerance through replication.
- [ ] Sharding: Learn how to horizontally scale a distributed database with sharding and consistent hashing.
- [ ] System Resilience: Build features that support data backup and restoration.
- [ ] Real-World Redis Features: Gain experience by mimicking real-world features like persistence and replication.

## Next Phase 
- [ ] [Rewrite the Raft Consensus Algorithm from scratch](https://github.com/yindia/raft) (No Wrapper) [CS244b: Distributed Systems](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/24sp-cs244b/sched/)
- [ ]
